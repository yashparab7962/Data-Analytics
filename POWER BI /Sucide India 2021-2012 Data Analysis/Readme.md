<h1>Project Description:</h1>

<h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
        The objective of this project is to analyze the trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to suicides in India over the period from 2012 to 2021 using Power BI. 
        This analysis aims to identify significant insights that can help in understanding the socio-economic, demographic, and geographical factors associated with suicide rates, 
        thereby aiding policymakers and stakeholders in devising effective prevention strategies.
    </p>


<h3>Data Source</h3>
    <p>
       The data used for this analysis is sourced from official government records, including the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reports, and other relevant public datasets available from 2012 to 2021. The dataset includes the following features: </p>
        <ul>
    <li>State</li>
    <li>Year</li>
    <li>Type_code</li>
    <li>Type</li>
    <li>Gender</li>
    <li>Age_group</li>
    <li>Total</li>
</ul>



<h3>Tools and Technologies:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Power BI: For data import, cleaning, transformation, and visualization.</li>
    <li>Microsoft Excel: For initial data inspection and preprocessing.</li>
    <li>Power Query: For data transformation and cleaning tasks.</li>
    <li>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating measures and calculated columns to enhance data analysis in Power BI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps and Methodology:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gather data from official sources such as government records, NCRB reports, and other relevant public datasets.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Inspection:</strong> Use Microsoft Excel to conduct an initial inspection of the data for completeness and accuracy.</li>
